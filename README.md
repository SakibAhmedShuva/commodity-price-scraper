# Commodity Price Scraper

A Python script to scrape and display commodity prices from [tradingeconomics.com](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodities).

## Story

My boss asked me to share a few fixed commodity prices on a daily basis, twice each day. This task quickly became hectic and time-consuming. To streamline the process, I prepared this code to get all the necessary information at once. Additionally, the texts are formatted for WhatsApp to give an impression of carefulness and professionalism ;)
